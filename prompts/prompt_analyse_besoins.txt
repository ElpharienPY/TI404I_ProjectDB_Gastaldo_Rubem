methodology.

COMPLETE PROMPT TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You work in the field of PROFESSIONAL TENNIS TOURNAMENT MANAGEMENT.

Your ORGANIZATION is involved in the domain of ORGANIZING AND MANAGING THE 
ROLAND-GARROS GRAND SLAM TENNIS TOURNAMENT.

It is an ORGANIZATION such as the French Tennis Federation (FFT) which 
organizes Roland-Garros, the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) which 
organizes Wimbledon, or the United States Tennis Association (USTA) which 
organizes the US Open.

The organization collects data about:
• Registered tennis players and their ATP/WTA rankings
• Scheduled matches with dates and times
• Match results and detailed scores by sets
• Tennis courts and their characteristics (surface type, capacity)
• Match officials including chair umpires and line judges
• Detailed match statistics such as aces, double faults, and break points
• Tournament phases from qualifications to finals
• Player coaches and support staff
• Ticket sales with different categories (VIP, tribune, lawn access)
• Spectators and their information
• Tournament sponsors and partnership contracts
• Prize money distribution
• Partner hotels for player accommodations

Take inspiration from the following WEBSITES AND RESOURCES:
• https://www.rolandgarros.com (official tournament website with structure, 
  organization, and historical data)
• https://www.atptour.com (ATP rankings, player profiles, and statistics)
• https://www.wtatennis.com (WTA rankings and women's tennis data)
• https://www.fft.fr (French Tennis Federation organizational structure)

Your ORGANIZATION wants to apply MERISE to design an information system. You 
are responsible for the analysis part, i.e., gathering the organization's 
requirements. It has called on a computer engineering student to carry out 
this project, and you must provide them with the necessary information so 
that they can then apply the following steps of database design and 
development themselves.

First, establish the data business rules for your ORGANIZATION in the form 
of a bulleted list. It must correspond to the information provided by someone 
who knows how the organization works, but not how an information system is 
built.

Next, based on these rules, provide a raw data dictionary with the following 
columns, grouped in a table: meaning of the data, type, size in number of 
characters or digits. There should be between 25 and 35 data items. It is 
used to provide additional information about each data item (size and type) 
but without any assumptions about how the data will be modeled later.

Provide the business rules and the data dictionary.
